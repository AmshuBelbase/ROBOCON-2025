# Three-Wheeled Omni-Directional Robot
## About
The three-wheeled omnidirectional robot in this project can move precisely and smoothly in any direction. The robot can move precisely forward, backward, laterally, diagonally, clockwise and anti-clockwise thanks to its inverse kinematics movement control system, which is controlled by a PS4 controller. Because of its stability and balance optimization, the design guarantees precise control on a variety of surfaces and when changing directions quickly. Speed settings that can be changed improve control and avoid overheating, which increases longevity and safety.
